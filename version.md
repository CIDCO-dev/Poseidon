# Version History (English)

## 2026-01-08
- e2e: allow launching `launchROSService.sh` via sudo when `POSEIDON_E2E_LAUNCH_AS_ROOT=1`, with root-aware cleanup for the service process.
- CI: set `POSEIDON_E2E_LAUNCH_AS_ROOT=1` for hardware E2E runs to ensure sensor access.

## 2025-12-18
- e2e: added Playwright-based headless UI smoke test (verifies `diagnostics.html` populates diagnostics + running nodes tables and required sensor diagnostics report OK; optional telemetry check on `index.html`).
- e2e: added unified runner script that starts Poseidon, serves `www/webroot`, waits for ports, runs backend websocket E2E + UI headless checks, and stores artifacts under `test/e2e/artifacts`.
- diagnostics/e2e: gated the launchROSService websocket test behind `POSEIDON_E2E=1` and added `POSEIDON_E2E_REUSE_RUNNING=1` to support CI benches that already run ROS.
- diagnostics: start the WebSocket server from inside the asyncio loop to be compatible with newer `websockets` versions (fixes port 9099 not opening on some systems).
- launch: made `launchROSService.sh` relocatable via `POSEIDON_ROOT` (no longer hard-coded to `/opt/Poseidon`).
- launch: avoid `set -u` in `launchROSService.sh` so sourcing `/opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash` does not fail when ROS scripts reference unset variables (fixes CI E2E startup).
- launch/e2e: pass `loggerPath` and `configPath` from `POSEIDON_LOGGER_PATH` / `POSEIDON_CONFIG_PATH` via `launchROSService.sh` (avoids invalid nested `$(optenv ...)` substitutions in roslaunch args).
- CI: added optional "hardware E2E" workflow steps (Playwright install, run E2E, upload artifacts) triggered on `workflow_dispatch` or pushes to `main/master`.
- diagnostics/e2e: make IMU/sonar communication thresholds configurable via env vars (`POSEIDON_DIAG_IMU_*`, `POSEIDON_DIAG_SONAR_*`) to reduce false negatives on slower benches.
- e2e: allow tuning diagnostics refresh polling delay via `POSEIDON_E2E_DIAGNOSTICS_REFRESH_DELAY_MS` for longer-running diagnostics windows.
- e2e: on UI failure, runner now dumps `roslaunch` tail + basic `rostopic`/diagnostics websocket debug into the job logs for faster triage.
- e2e: avoid `set -u` in the E2E runner when sourcing ROS setup scripts (prevents `ROS_DISTRO: unbound variable` on some environments).
- e2e: keep a DBT NMEA writer running for the whole E2E so `/depth` can be validated when `DIAGNOSTICS_FAKE_SERIAL_PORT` is available.
- e2e: optional exclusive mode (`POSEIDON_E2E_EXCLUSIVE=1`) stops the system `ros` service and frees websocket ports before starting Poseidon to avoid port conflicts on benches.
- launch: pass `sonarDevice` into the Hydrobox launch and map it to `/Sonar/device` so the sonar node can be pointed at a test serial adapter.

## 2025-12-03
- diagnostics: added end-to-end nosetest that launches `launchROSService.sh`, waits for the 9099 diagnostics websocket, sends `updateDiagnostic`, and validates the returned payload; optional DBT feed on `DIAGNOSTICS_FAKE_SERIAL_PORT` (default `/dev/ttyUSB1`) to drive sonar without touching `/dev/sonar`.
- diagnostics: declare `python3-websockets` as exec/test dependency so websocket clients/servers are available during integration runs.
- diagnostics: fixed indentation in the launchROSService websocket test teardown to avoid SyntaxErrors during nosetests.
- diagnostics: guarded `asyncio.set_event_loop` in `diagnostics_websocket.start_server` to prevent dummy-loop `AssertionError` in unit tests.

## 2025-12-02
- Web UI: System Status now shows wlan0 state + SSID using sysfs/proc+iwgetid (no nmcli dependency in telemetry path).
- hydroball_data_websocket: publish Wi‑Fi status/SSID in telemetry payload (`telemetry.wifi`), sourced from `/sys/class/net/wlan0/operstate` and `/proc/net/wireless`.
- wifi_file_transfer_config: remove legacy C++ backups; node now purges old Wi‑Fi connections on config change and documentation/comments converted to English.
- wifi_file_transfer_config: added Python unit tests for wifi_config_node (helpers, nmconnection parsing, autoconnect parsing, purge logic, configuration callback) wired via catkin nosetests.
- Launch: replace missing `diagnostics_node` with `diagnostics_websocket.py` in Hydrobox/Hydroball/Simulator launch files to fix diagnostics startup errors.
- diagnostics: add package-path fallback so diagnostics_websocket imports sibling diagnostic modules when run from install space (fix ModuleNotFoundError on diagnostics_test_base).
- diagnostics: fix `getRunningNodes` handler to unpack publisher/subscriber/service lists correctly (no more "too many values to unpack").
- diagnostics: add DNS resolution check (`google.com`) and Internet connectivity check (`http://example.com`) to the diagnostics suite.
- diagnostics: run Internet connectivity first and skip DNS/API checks when connectivity fails to reduce noisy errors.
- diagnostics: API connection test now uses a configurable timeout (default 2s) to avoid hanging when the API domain is blocked.
- diagnostics: added unit tests for the diagnostics websocket node (commands, node listing, lifecycle helpers) to cover its behaviors without ROS master dependencies.
- diagnostics: install the websocket integration test into the package bin path and skip cleanly when the `websockets` module is missing, so rostest can locate/execute it without false negatives.
- install: rewrote `install/stages/ethernet_move_hotspot_rpi4.sh` with Unix line endings so the bash shebang runs without `/bin/bash^M` errors.
- install: fixed `ethernet_move_hotspot_rpi4.sh` variable handling (no more escaped `$`/awk errors) and robust interface-name replacement in Hotspot.nmconnection.
- launch: All Hydrobox profiles now start `wifi_file_transfer_config_node` so Wi‑Fi provisioning is consistent across RPi/Rock and simulator setups.
- launch: Fixed wifi file transfer node type to `wifi_config_node.py` in all launch profiles/simulator so roslaunch can locate the installed Python node.
- wifi_file_transfer_config: protect hotspot/non-target interfaces (e.g., wlan1) and force new connections onto `wlan0`; skip deleting hotspot profiles when applying Wi‑Fi config.
- wifi_file_transfer_config: refuse to apply Wi‑Fi changes if the hotspot interface (default wlan1) is missing and guard against running when the target interface is absent.
- hydroball_data_websocket: use nmcli to populate Wi‑Fi SSID/state, drop iwgetid dependency, and clear SSID when disconnected.
- Web UI (status): Wi‑Fi row matches other bars (full-width gradient green/red) with SSID + state inline in the header; bar color now follows `wifi.state` up/down.
- Tests: update statusScript Jest stubs to support `.css()` chaining after Wi‑Fi bar changes.

## 2025-12-01
- diagnostics: added rostest that launches the WebSocket node and validates `updateDiagnostic` response payload (catkin test friendly).
- raspberrypi_vitals: declare logger_service and power_management_msg dependencies so ToggleLogging and battery message headers exist at build time.
- diagnostics: install the websocket integration test script via catkin so rostest can locate/execute it.
- ROS tests: add pytest skip guards for ROS-dependent Python tests to avoid failures when ROS Python modules are absent.

## 2025-11-27
- CI: gcovr step split into separate XML/HTML runs (no more skipped HTML output) and coverage summary script now falls back to lcov/HTML when XML is absent.
- CI: coverage summary now also falls back to JS lcov when coverage-summary.json is missing (ensures JS coverage is reported).
- CI: coverage summary surfaces JUnit test totals/errors/failures and lists failing suites (links to junit-test-results artifact).
- JS: VM-based Jest tests now instrument scripts before execution so coverage is reported correctly (no longer 0%).
- raspberrypi_vitals: ensure targets depend on generated messages (catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS) and declare i2c_controller_service in CATKIN_DEPENDS to fix missing `raspberrypi_vitals_msg/sysinfo.h` during build.
- gnss_zed_f9p: declare binary_stream_msg/virtual_serial_port deps and depend on catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS so generated headers (e.g., Stream.h) exist before building.
